# Memory Management Simulation

This repository contains a simulation of memory management techniques in a multiprogrammed operating system environment.  
It was developed as part of the *Operating Systems* course at **Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas**.

---

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to model and analyze how different memory allocation strategies operate within a system.  
Through a web-based implementation using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, users can interact with the simulation and visualize how memory is allocated, released, and fragmented under various conditions.

---

## Implemented Methods

- **Fixed Partitions** — Memory divided into equal-size blocks prior to execution.  
- **Variable Partitions** — Memory divided into predefined blocks of different sizes.  
- **Dynamic Partitions** — Memory dynamically allocated and deallocated at runtime, with and without compaction.  

Each method demonstrates its advantages, limitations, and the impact of fragmentation on overall system performance.

---

## Features

- Interactive visualization of memory allocation and fragmentation.  
- Comparison of internal and external fragmentation effects.  
- Multiple allocation strategies available for analysis.  
- Simple and structured web interface for educational purposes.

---

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure and content definition.  
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout management.  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Core logic and behavior of the simulator.
